     <p> My name is Renard Herbert and Im forming a talent group.In this group, we will focus on the main overall aspect of art, and applying it to our own methods to adapt a little more on the topic. There are many concepts of art.Art can come in any shapes and forms, such as graffiti, Drawing, a Statue, Dance, Singing, Rapping, and so much more. We actually  specialize in Dancing,Singing, Rapping, and possibly acting. There can be many things that people can use and do to create art, but lets start off with an ice breaker, <em><strong>What is art?</strong> </em> </p> 
     
     
        <h1><strong><em>What is Art!?</em></strong></h1>
     
     <p> Art is <strong>the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.</strong> In other words, art is the concept in which someone can express themselves through the form of movement, drawings, pictures, etc. Art can be found anywhere, it could be found in a building, on a sign, art is one of the many things that we look at everyday. Art comes in many forms, the most common is music. Many people make music, A Boogie, Travis Scott, Lil baby,Eminem and many others. </p>

    <h2>What is there to explore when it comes to art? </h2>
    
    <p> When it comes to art, there are many things to explore. Art can send a message to other inspired young artists, it can talk about a main problem, or just express ones self about ones life. People can use art in a variety of way, like a photo, a drawing, etc. One can use art to suit their needs.

    <h1>What are the aspects that we will focus on?</h1>
    
    <p> We will focus on the emotional aspect of art. We will always have something to learn about art. For instance, there are many reasons that someone many make choreography, or a specific song, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7Rp_vil9qw">Tyga: U cry</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfTbHITdhEI">Eminem: Fall</a> There can be many reasons to make a certain set of dance moves, or make a certain song, such as to raise awareness about a problem, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWASeaYuHZo">Alessia Cara: Scars to your Beautiful</a> or possibly explaining a tradgic thing that happened to them and how they feel about it, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lexLAjh8fPA">Eminem: Like Toy Soldiers</a> Music only has the ability to build up, not to tear down. Music can have some many influences on people, many to help for the better, rather to help for the worst</p>
    
    <h1>What connects people when it comes to art?</h1>
    
    <p>People can be connected by the lyrics, the meaning, the beat, etc. there are many things that people can be connected by when it comes to music. For example, there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiLsXg-24G4">Back to Beautiful: Sofia Carson</a> to explain that people shouldn't judge other people just because people act a certain way or behave a certain way, or explain the problems of a realationship, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-TkrWpO75k">Good Guy: Eminem Featuring Jessica Reyes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BXDsVD6O10">River: Eminem Featuring Ed Sheeran</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9bCLPwzSC0&list=PLC0w3lEHx2SF3NsbnqnLbWBWyF_3g0cjZ">Mockingbird: Eminem.</a>. The way of art can take many forms, for many, many reasons.</p>
    
    <h1>What Makes a Good Artist?</h1>
    
    <p>An artist can make many things on the fly, and can make their visions become a reality. An artist also tries to work on many other aspects of art rather than just their own strength/profession. And furthermore, there are many artists that are famous on all platforms, from youtube to spotify, and many more platforms. There are many artists that aren't as well known compared to others, like Futuristic compared to Chris Brown, or Polo G compared to Lil Durk, but in the end, people can be recognized by their style of music, style of dance, or style of rap. People are more likley to be known when it comes to music based on the material that they produce or the meaning of a song.</p>
